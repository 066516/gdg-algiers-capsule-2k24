I joined GDG Algiers in my second year at ESI Algiers, and like many others, it quickly became my second family. GDG Algiers is far more than just a club. And realizing this early on can open up a world of opportunities.

Here, I was able to meet some very talented individuals , work on my skills as a Development department member , participate to some amazing events and hackathons, and finally be part of a BIG community that I consider now to be my family.

Recently, I was honored to be promoted to External Relations Co-Manager, granting me access to our organizationâ€™s email. There , I was able to find a variety of photo albums , each one containing sometimes HUNDREDS of pictures of some previous events, some albums are VERY old (2018). 
In these pictures ,you can find people people laughing, coding, celebrating victories, and sharing unforgettable experiences.

How many friendships were created ? How many unforgettable events ? How many Core teams ? Development deparments ? 
all that under the same slogan "GDG for once, GDG forever".

Happy Birthday GDG Algiers. I hope this adventure will continue for a long time.
